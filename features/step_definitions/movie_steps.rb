# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|

end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  #  ensure that that e1 occurs before e2.
  #  page.content  is the entire content of the page as a string.
  assert page.body.index(e1) < page.body.index(e2)
